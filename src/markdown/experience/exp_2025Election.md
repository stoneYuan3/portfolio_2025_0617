# 2025 Federal Election Campaign

## Intro

Volunteered for the Federal Conservative Party candidate James Yan in Burnaby Central riding from January 2025 to the election day (April 28 2025). Door knocked over 3000 doors to identify Conservative Party voters and trained new door knocking volunteers during the campaign period.

## Takeaways

The most significant gain I have from this experience is social and communication skills. As I engage in door-to-door outreach, it allows me to interact with a diverse range of individuals, often having conversations with complete strangers, some are friendly some are not. This experience greatly improved my confidence in public speaking, listening, and effectively sharing my messages to others, which I believe will benefit me in both professional and personal settings.

Other than communication skills, I also built meaningful connections to candidate James Yan and other members of the canvassing team.
