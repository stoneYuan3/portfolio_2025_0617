Internship Project, Individual

2022

This project was done during a graphic design internship with Simon Fraser University's Institutional Strategic Awards (ISA). For this project, my task was to design a series of website banners for ISA's website.

To complete the task, I searched through potentially useful images from online resources and ISA's image stock and put them together in a way that reflects the topic of the webpage with Adobe Photoshop.
