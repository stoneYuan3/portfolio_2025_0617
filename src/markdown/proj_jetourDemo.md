# Jetour Home Page Demo Development

### Type:

Front-end development

### Skills:

HTML, CSS, Javascript

### Context:

Front-end development Internship project

### Time:

August 2023

Part of the Jetour website maintenance project mentioned in the resume. Asked to fix the Vue.js and React.js powered map page of the original Jetour website. The original map page had issues with search bars and broken layout consistency in mobile and different language versions.

Added a Vue.js powered search bar and fixed layout glitches in right-to-left language versions and mobile versions with the Swiper.js plugin.

## Gain:

Practised my Vue.js skill by putting the knowledge I learnt in my own time before this project. Had an increased understanding towards compatibility issues across different languages.
